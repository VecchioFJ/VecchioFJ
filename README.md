### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an industrial engineer passionate about programming and Fullstack development. With solid experience in project coordination and application of continuous improvement methods, I have the ability to analyze data and efficiently manage resources. Recently, I completed the bootcamp at Henry, where I acquired knowledge in various languages and libraries.

I combine my solid engineering background with programming skills to tackle challenges holistically and collaborate in multidisciplinary teams. My focus is on efficiency, process optimization, and delivering quality results. I am eager to bring my skills and experience to a challenging and collaborative work environment in the field of Fullstack development.
